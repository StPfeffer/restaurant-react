# Gericht Restaurant

This website was made following the youtube video [Build and Deploy a Fully Responsive Restaurant Website with Modern UI and UX in ReactJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oV65GVVits) in order to familiarize myself with the syntax of ReactJS.

## Usage

If you don't have Node.js, you can follow the installation guides from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) website.

If you already have Node.js installed in your machine, simply run the following commands in your terminal:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/StPfeffer/restaurante.git
$ cd restaurant-react
$ npm start
```
